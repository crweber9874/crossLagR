Whereas dozens of options exist for analyzing longer time series, researchers wishing to analyze cross-sectionally dominant panel structures – in which there are more units than time points – face a more limited set of choices. National surveys like found in the American National Election Studies (ANES) may consist of just a handful of waves, with many respondents interviewed only once or twice. We consider of the popular methods for analyzing panel data in political science. We start by focusing on a common approach to estimate dynamic processes in panel data (particularly public opinion panel data that are “cross section” dominant, with far more respondents than panel waves: the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM – introduced by Stanley and Campbell (1963) and extended on by Kenny (1975) – has been widely used to study reciprocal relationships between variables over time. These methods first appeared in the political science literature in the late 1970s [e.g, ;Abramowitz (1978); Campbell and Meier (1979); Iyengar (1978); Jennings and Markus (1977); Markus (1979b); Markus and Converse (1979),Meier and Campbell (1979)]. The availability of two large panel surveys with rich political content – Jennings and Niemi’s Jennings and Niemi (1974) socialization study and the ANES 1972-1974-1976 panel – likely promoted the CLPM’s adoption, as most of the cross-lagged analyses published in this era analyze these two datasets. Another factor leading to the widespread adoption of the CLPM was the availability of Jöreskog’s LISREL software, which allowed researchers to quickly and easily solve systems of equations using maximum likelihood (Markus 1979a; McCullough 1978; Shingles 1976). Much of the CLPM’s appeal lies in its intuitive structure, flexibility, and ease of implementation. In the half century after its introduction, the CLPM has also been refined and extended, due to important limitations in its original formulation. For instance, the model can account for unobserved heterogeneity across individuals – stable characteristics of individuals that confound the “dynamic” estimates in the CLPM (Usami, Hayes, and McArdle 2015; Usami 2021; Klopack and Wickrama 2020; Kim and Steiner 2021; Lüdtke and Robitzsch 2022; McArdle 2009). Because the CLPM does not account for stable unit effects, the cross-lagged estimates will tend to be biased (upwards), as they conflate within-person dynamics with between-person differences. Though not directly referenced as a critique of the CLPM, Hsiao (2022) shows that including a lagged dependent variable will produce a biased estimate of the lagged effect, because the variable is correlated with the error term. The correlation arises from the failure to account for “between unit” heterogeneity (pp. 64 -67). As a consequence, CLPM estimates may be biased, especially when the variables of interest exhibit high stability over time (Hamaker, Kuiper, and Grasman 2015; Usami, Hayes, and McArdle 2015; Lüdtke and Robitzsch 2022). This problem is elaborated on in@hsiao2022. Dynamic models – models that include lagged dependent variables – often result in correlations between the observed variables and the error terms, leading to biased estimates. Hsiao (2022) proposes and instrumental variable approach using lagged values of the dependent variable as instruments. When stable unit effects are ignored, the lagged dependent variable becomes correlated with the error term, violating the exogeneity assumption. This correlation leads to biased estimates of the lagged effect. Another popular extension to the CLPM is the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) proposed in (hamaker2015?), which separates within-person dynamics from between-person “trait” effects (Usami, Hayes, and McArdle 2015; Lüdtke and Robitzsch 2022). Another approach is the Latent Change Score Model (LSCM), which focuses more directly on estimating different change processes; the LCSM also accounts for stable unit effects, by accounting for unit averaged change (Usami, Hayes, and McArdle 2015; McArdle 2009; Kim and Steiner 2021). Another alternative is the latent growth model (LGM), which models individual trajectories over time (Usami, Hayes, and McArdle 2015; McArdle and Nesselroade 2003). Ultimately,preference for one model over another is strongly tied to data access and availability. While the CLPM and a restrictive version of the LCSM can be estimated with as few as two waves of data, the RI-CLPM, LGM, and LCSM require more panel waves to properly identify the models. Data with three or more waves of data afford more leverage to estimate dynamic relationships. In this project, we elaborate on these models, beginning with the CLPM and change score approach to modeling dynamic relationships. 1.1 The Cross-Lagged Panel Model The cross-lagged regression model follows an intuitive structure. The current realizations \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are a function of autoregressive and cross lagged effects. The autoregression terms capture time dependence, while the cross-lagged terms capture how another variable leads to change in the outcome variable. The CLPM can may be estimated as series of simultaneous equations with lagged realizations of the \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\). \\[ \\begin{matrix} y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} + \\beta_{1}y_{it-1} + \\omega_x x_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{1}x_{it-1} + \\omega_x y_{it-1}+ e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] \\(\\alpha\\) correspond to intercepts, which may vary across units (e.g., survey respondents) as well as panel wave. It is common to write the CLPM with mean centered variables, in which case the intercept is 0. The \\(\\beta\\) parameters are autoregressive effects. And the \\(\\omega\\) parameters are cross-lagged effects. Figure 1.1: The Cross-Lagged Panel Model It’s useful to write the CLPM in terms of latent variables – “p” and “q” – for the simple reason that this formulation can easily be extended to models with measurement error, varying factor structures, and multiple indicators per construct. In a “single indicator” latent variable model, \\(y = p\\) and \\(x = q\\). With multiple indicators, the CLPM can account for measurement error. Each indicator is defined by the latent variable, and an error term (the dashed loops). Figure 1.2: The Cross-Lagged Panel Model with Multiple Indicators In addition, insofar as the constructs measured at each time point are modeled as latent variables, the CLPM can be extended to account for correlated errors, factor invariance, and multiple group comparisons. Below we write the CLPM and alternatives in terms of single indicator variables, though importantly, these models can all easily account for multiple indicators. 1.2 The Change Score Regression The CLPM is related to the change score regression model (Allison 1990). The change score regression directly constructs change between time points (e.g, \\(\\Delta y_{i,t} = y_{it} - y{i,t-1}\\)). \\[ \\Delta y_{it} = y_{it} - y_{it-1}\\\\ \\Delta x_{it} = x_{it} - x_{it-1} \\] And \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\Delta y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} + \\beta_{y}y_{it-1} + \\theta_x x_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ \\Delta x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x}x_{it-1} + \\theta_x y_{it-1}+ e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] The \\(\\beta\\) parameter here corresponds to a “proportional” effect. Does the prior value \\(y_{t-1}\\) influence the amount of change in \\(y\\) from time \\(t-1\\) to time \\(t\\)? \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\text{The CLPM: } &amp;y_{it} = \\beta_{y}y_{t-1} + \\theta_{1y} x_{t-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ \\text{Subtract } y_{it-1}: &amp;y_{it} - y_{it-1} = \\beta_{y}y_{t-1} + \\theta_{1y} x_{t-1} + e_{y,it} - y_{it-1}\\\\ &amp; \\Delta y_{it} = (\\beta_{y} - 1) y_{t-1} + \\theta_{y} x_{t-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ &amp; \\Delta y_{it} = \\tilde{\\beta}_y y_{t-1} + \\theta_{y} x_{t-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ \\text{Where: } &amp;\\tilde{\\beta}_y = \\beta_{x} - 1 \\end{matrix} \\] The change regression and CLPM are interchangeable, and the lagged and cross-lagged effects simply become proportional and cross-proportional effects on change scores. . 1.3 Example: CLPM and Change Score Regression # Simulate a five wave panel, with two variables, x y: simCLPM(waves = 5)$data |&gt; # In crossLagR there is a helper function to transform wide to long reshape_long_sim_cr() |&gt; # Id identifies the subject, so use this to construct lags group_by(id) |&gt; mutate( y_lag = lag(y), x_lag = lag(x), # Change Score delta_y = y - lag(y) ) |&gt; ungroup() -&gt; data head(data) ## # A tibble: 6 × 13 ## id wave x y xlag xlagw ylag ylagw within.x within.y ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 -0.172 -0.137 NA NA NA NA -0.281 -0.380 ## 2 1 2 -1.34 -0.0618 -0.172 -0.281 -0.137 -0.380 -1.45 -0.304 ## 3 1 3 0.907 0.420 -1.34 -1.45 -0.0618 -0.304 0.798 0.178 ## 4 1 4 1.05 0.217 0.907 0.798 0.420 0.178 0.945 -0.0249 ## 5 1 5 0.0994 0.773 1.05 0.945 0.217 -0.0249 -0.00964 0.530 ## 6 2 1 -0.408 -2.25 NA NA NA NA -0.846 -1.98 ## # ℹ 3 more variables: y_lag &lt;dbl&gt;, x_lag &lt;dbl&gt;, delta_y &lt;dbl&gt; ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = delta_y ~ y_lag + x_lag, data = data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.4791 -0.6758 -0.0152 0.6779 2.9148 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In the latent change score model (an extension of the change score regression), one can explicitly model change as a latent variable, and decompose change into constituent processes, “proportional change,” “constant change,” and “dual change” (Grimm et al. 2012). 1.4 Types of Change The univariate change score regression model allows us to decompose change into three components: constant, proportional, and dual change processes (Grimm et al. 2012). \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\Delta y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} s_i + \\beta_{1}y_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ \\Delta x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} s_i + \\beta_{1}x_{it-1} + e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] The \\(\\alpha\\) parameters are the effects of a stable trait level component, \\(s_i\\), on the change scores. The \\(\\alpha\\) parameter captures the effect of \\(s_i\\) on the change score at a particular time point. The \\(\\beta\\) parameters are the proportional effect of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) at time \\(t-1\\) on the change score at time \\(t\\). The trajectory\\(y\\) and \\(x\\) from time \\(t=1\\) to time \\(t=k\\). \\[ y_{i,k} = y_{i,t=1} + \\sum_{t=2}^{k} \\Delta y_{ik} \\\\ x_{i,k} = x_{i,t=1} + \\sum_{t=2}^{k} \\Delta x_{ik} \\\\ \\] Cross-lagged effects can also be included in the change score regression model, allowing us to examine how change in one variable is influenced by the level of another variable at the prior time point. Cross-lagged coefficients can be interpreted as cross-proportional effects, indicating how much that variable changes the trajectory of change in the dependent variable. \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\Delta y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} s_i + \\beta_{1}y_{it-1} + \\theta_x x_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ \\Delta x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} s_i + \\beta_{1}x_{it-1} + \\theta_x y_{it-1}+ e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] 1.5 Unit Effects Some researchers have proposed including unit-level fixed effects in the CLPM to account for stable between-person differences. Following Hsiao (2021), the “fixed effects” model either includes dummy variables for each unit, or equivalently, subtracts the unit average from the dependent variable. Assume the true data generating process is a CLPM with dummy indicator in the error equation, \\(s_i\\): \\[ \\begin{matrix} y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} + \\beta_{1}y_{it-1} + \\omega_x x_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{1}x_{it-1} + \\omega_x y_{it-1} + e_{x,it}\\\\ e_{y,it} &amp; = s_i + u_{y,it}\\\\ e_{x,it} &amp; = s_i + u_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] Setting aside the cross-lagged coefficient, i.e, \\(\\omega_x = 0\\), if one fits the standard CLPM without accounting for \\(s_i\\), the estimates will be biased. \\[ \\begin{matrix} y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} + \\beta_{y}y_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x}x_{it-1} + e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] In this model, \\(\\hat\\beta\\) corresponds to \\[ \\begin{matrix} \\hat\\beta_y &amp;=&amp; {cov(y_{it}, y_{it-1}) \\over var(y_{it-1})}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; {cov(\\beta y_{it-1} + s_i + u_{y,it}, y_{it-1}) \\over var(y_{it-1})}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{cov(\\beta_y y_{it-1}, y_{it-1}) + cov(s_i, y_{it-1}) + cov(u_{y,it}, y_{it-1})}{var(y_{it-1})}\\\\ (\\text{Exogeneity}) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\beta_y \\cdot var(y_{it-1}) + cov(s_i, y_{it-1})}{var(y_{it-1})}\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\beta_y + \\frac{cov(s_i, y_{it-1})}{var(y_{it-1})}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] The stable unit level effect, \\(s_i\\) – invariant across time – is part of the error. Unless it is uncorrelated with \\(y_{it-1}\\), \\(\\hat\\beta_y\\) will be biased. Conditioning on \\(s_i\\) – including a fixed or random effect for each unit – attempts to remove this source of bias. For instance, the Random Intercept Cross Lagged Regression Model models “within” versus “between” person effects. A stable, trait level component – invariant across time – is modeled alongside “within” person fluctuations around this stable estimate. 1.6 The Random Intercept Cross Lagged Regression The RICLPM – a popular approach in psychology – also explicitly includes trait level variation, but in a manner somewhat different from the difference score approaches described. For the moment, ignoring the lags and cross-lagged effects, let us assume that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are each a function of a stable trait level component, plus a time-varying state component. The RICLPM is an extension of the CLPM, \\[ \\begin{matrix} y_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{y} + \\beta_{y}y_{it-1} + e_{y,it}\\\\ x_{it} &amp; = \\alpha_{x} + \\beta_{x}x_{it-1} + e_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] But the RICLPM includes a stable trait level component, \\(\\mu_i\\), for each individual \\(i\\): \\[ \\begin{matrix} y_{it} = \\mu^y_{i} + y^*_{y,it}\\\\ x_{it} = \\mu^x_{i} + x^*_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] The \\(\\mu^x_i\\) and \\(\\mu^y_i\\) terms are the stable, trait level components for individual \\(i\\). And \\(x^*_{t,i}\\) and \\(y^*_{t,i}\\) terms are the time-varying state components. We can view this formation as providing a decomposition of the total variance in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into between-person (trait; \\(\\mu\\)) and within-person (state, \\(x^*,y^*\\)) components. From here, we can rewrite the cross-lagged and lagged effects from the state components alone. \\[ \\begin{matrix} y^*_{it} &amp; = \\beta_{y}y^*_{it-1} + \\omega_{y}x^*_{it-1} + e^*_{y,it}\\\\ x^*_{it} &amp; = \\beta_{x}x^*_{it-1} + \\omega_{x}y^*_{it-1} + e^*_{x,it}\\\\ \\end{matrix} \\] Unlike the CLPM, the RICLPM examines residualized change, or change net of stable trait level differences between individuals. The “dynamic” part of the model captures whether fluctation around the respondent’s mean on \\(x\\) relates to fluctuations around the respondent’s mean on \\(y\\) at the next time point, and vice versa. The RICLPM thus focuses on within-person effects – \\(y^*_{it}\\) and \\(x^*_{it}\\) represent deviations from the individual’s mean score for \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Figure 1.3: Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model with 5 waves. The model shows autoregressive paths (solid arrows), cross-lagged effects (solid arrows), within-time correlations (dashed curved arrows), and residual terms (self-loops). As shown in Figure 1.3, the RI-CLPM separates between-person and within-person effects. The next section builds on these two models, using synthetic data, to illustrate the similarities and similarities between these approaches. 1.7 The Latent Growth Model The Latent Growth Model (LGM) provides another approach. As opposed to modeling autoregressive and cross-lagged effects directly, the LGCM models change over time using latent intercept and slope factors. The model imposes a particular type of growth on all units – linear, quadratic, exponential – but otherwise growth trajectories can be estimated for each unit. Figure 1.4: Latent Growth Model, Linear Trend. What’s particularly useful about this approach is that one can model individual differences in growth trajectories. This is indicated by the triangle shaped intercept term on the left – the model allows one to estimate unit values on all intercept and slope factors.The correlations between the latent growth factors, the intercepts \\(I\\) and slopes, \\(S\\) for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) capture unique relationships. \\(cor(S_X, I_X)\\): Captures whether individuals with higher initial levels of \\(x\\) also tend to have more rapid growth in \\(x\\) over time. \\(cor(S_Y, I_Y)\\): Captures whether individuals with higher initial levels of \\(y\\) also tend to have more rapid growth in \\(Y\\) over time. \\(cor(S_X, S_Y)\\): Captures whether individuals who experience more rapid growth in \\(x\\) also experience more rapid growth in \\(y\\) over time. \\(cor(I_X, I_Y)\\): Captures whether individuals with higher initial values (i.e., wave 1) of \\(x\\) also have higher starting values on \\(y\\). \\(cor(S_X, I_Y)\\): Captures whether individuals with higher initial values for \\(y\\) tend to experience more growth in \\(x\\) over time. \\(cor(S_Y, I_X)\\): Captures whether individuals with higher initial values for \\(x\\) tend to experience more growth in \\(y\\) over time. The latent growth model requires a minimum of two waves to estimate linear growth, and three or more waves to estimate quadratic growth. 1.8 Measurement Error Using latent variable structural equation models to estimate panel data relationships, whether that be change, growth, autoregression, and cross-lagged effects, allows researchers to remove measurement error by specifying multiple-indicator latent variables (Bollen 1989; Sullivan and Feldman 1979). While less effective than latent variable modelling, averaging multiple items to create scales can also be effective at reducing measurement error (Ansolabehere, Rodden, and Snyder 2008). Measurement error can pose serious challenges to correctly obtaining cross-lagged parameters from CLPMs and change score models. Moreover, the resulting bias is not random. Instead, it will systematically inflate the size of the cross-lagged parameter estimates and increase the risk of false positives. In the next section, these models are estimated and compared using synthetic data.
