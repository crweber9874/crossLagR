	abstract = {States that over the past decade investigators have attempted to decompose variance in measures simultaneously into trait and state variance, and that there are currently two major approaches—the latent state–trait (LST) model as suggested by Steyer and colleagues, and the authors' own stable trait (ST), autoregressive trait (ART or AR), and state (S), or STARTS model (previously called the "trait–state–error model"). Both models partition variance in longitudinal data into trait and state components. In this chapter, the authors focus on these two models. Additionally, they show that the multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM; Campbell and Fiske, 1959) is relevant for the analysis of the matrix suggested by Kenny and Campbell (1989), that a preliminary MTMM analysis is helpful in determining how to proceed in the analysis of stability. These different models are evaluated in terms of the criteria: design, model conceptualization, model assumption plausibility, and estimation methods and difficulty. They illustrate each model's strengths and weakness through analysis of a secondary data set collected from 433 female adolescents measured 4 times at 6-mo intervals on the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale.

We first demonstrate that national collective narcissism, nationalism, and mere satisfaction with national ingroup are distinct. In turn, in both cross-sectional and panel analyses, we find that (1) national collective narcissism is positively related to nationalism, whereas satisfaction with the national ingroup is not; and (2) national collective narcissism is a stronger predictor of nationalism than national ingroup satisfaction is in absolute terms. Our analyses thus provide evidence that nationalism may be rooted in narcissistic exaggeration of the greatness of the national ingroup rather than nonnarcissistic national ingroup satisfaction.},

Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

First, it demonstrates the generality of this model. Rather than treating path analysis, recursive and nonrecursive models, classical econometrics, and confirmatory factor analysis as unique, they are treated as special cases of a common model. The second purpose is to emphasize the application of these techniques. Empirical examples appear throughout. Several chapters contain some of the LISREL or EQS programs the author used to obtain the results for the empirical examples. Finally, the book explores the crucial role played by substantive expertise in most stages of the modeling process.  "Structural Equations with Latent Variables" fills the gap existing in the treatment of this subject between introductory texts and specialized papers. It provides social scientists, market researchers, applied statisticians, other analysts, and graduate students with a thorough examination of LISREL/structural equation models. At the same time it presents new material on measurement reliability and validity, overall fit indices, model identification, and other topics.

	abstract = {Panel data, which consist of information gathered from the same individuals or units at several different points in time, are commonly used in the social sciences to test theories of individual and social change. The most important feature of panel studies is that, in contrast to static cross-sectional analyses, change is explicitly incorporated into the design so that individual (or other unit-level) changes in a set of variables are directly measured. Panel data may also be distinguished from 2 other forms of longitudinal data: "repeated cross-section" or "trend" data, which consist of information collected on the same variables for different units over time; and "time series" data, which consist of observations collected on several variables for a single unit at multiple points in time. The distinctiveness of panel data is that they contain measures of the same variables from numerous units observed repeatedly through time.  This monograph provides an overview of models appropriate for the analysis of panel data, focusing specifically on the area where panels offer major advantages over cross-sectional research designs: the analysis of causal interrelationships among variables.

Theories of democratic participation argue that positive effects should be seen for at least the first three modes, while little is known about the effects of political violence. Using longitudinal data from the mid-1970s in West Germany, it becomes apparent that these modes of participation have vastly different effects on these political orientations. Voting is found to influence regime support in a positive fashion, while campaign activities influence feelings of political efficacy. Peaceful protest has little effect on either attitude, and aggressive behavior has strong negative effects on regime support. The results are discussed in light of theories of democracy which predict developmental effects of political activity, and in light of previous research which investigates these effects in other countries and in other contexts.},

Politically trustful individuals, both Democrats and Republicans, are more supportive of pro-immigration policies. These findings underscore the political relevance of trust in government and show that public attitudes toward immigration are not driven solely by feelings about immigrant groups, partisanship, core political values, nor personality traits, but are also affected by trust in government, the actor most responsible for managing immigration policy.},

First, we conceptualize and measure secular orientations in a new way—not just as the absence of religion, but also as an affirmative secular identity and positive commitment to secular principles. Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations. Third, we isolate the conditions under which politics affects religious–secular perspectives, thus identifying the mechanism that underlies political orientations.},

Vector autoregression results indicate that opinion “causes” coverage in every case, and the reverse holds less frequently and always to a lesser degree.

First, by investigating the impact of authoritarianism on political attitudes and voting, net of individual heterogeneity, thus improving causal estimation. Second, by investigating the extent to which there exists reverse causality between authoritarianism and political attitudes. To do so, we employ a longitudinal analysis that covers a timespan of two years using the 2021 British Election Study Panel. The results suggest that authoritarianism in Britain is positively associated with anti-immigration attitudes, anti-EU preferences, and opposition to economic redistribution. However, when accounting for potential confounding through the inclusion of individual fixed effects, we find that authoritarianism retains its significant association with anti-immigration preferences alone. Further, lagged relations between authoritarianism and immigration preferences indicate that within-person changes in immigration attitudes precede changes in authoritarianism—not the other way around. Finally, the findings indicate that authoritarianism’s correlation with vote choice is a product of omitted variable bias rather than representing a causal relationship.},

While some worry that people increasingly are seeking out likeminded views, others propose that newer media provide an increased opportunity for exposure to diverse views. In returning to the concept of selective exposure, this article argues that certain topics, such as politics, are more likely to inspire selective exposure and that research should investigate habitual media exposure patterns, as opposed to single exposure decisions. This study investigates whether different media types (newspapers, political talk radio, cable news, and Internet) are more likely to inspire selective exposure. Using data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey, evidence supports the idea that people’s political beliefs are related to their media exposure—a pattern that persists across media types. Over-time analyses suggest that people’s political beliefs motivate their media use patterns and that cable news audiences became increasingly politically divided over the course of the 2004 election.

MFT posits that political attitudes are rooted in instinctual evaluations generated by innate psychological modules evolved to solve social dilemmas. If this is correct, moral foundations must be relatively stable dispositional traits, changes in moral foundations should systematically predict consequent changes in political orientations, and, at least in part, moral foundations must be heritable. We test these hypotheses and find substantial variability in individual-level moral foundations across time, and little evidence that these changes account for changes in political attitudes. We also find little evidence that moral foundations are heritable. These findings raise questions about the future of MFT as a theory of ideology.},

We argue that the political trust heuristic is activated when individuals are asked to sacrifice ideological as well as material interests. Aggregate- and individual-level analysis shows that the effects of political trust on support for government spending are moderated by ideology. Consistent with the unbalanced ideological costs imposed by requests for increased government spending, we find that the effects of political trust are significantly more pronounced among conservatives than among liberals. The analysis further demonstrates that ideology conditions the effects of political trust on attitudes toward both distributive and redistributive spending. Our findings suggest that political trust has policy consequences across a much broader range of policy issues than previously thought.},

Previous research studies have reported mixed results concerning the relationship between political participation and mental health.

In the current study, the bidirectional relationship between political participation and mental health was investigated. Methods Data from the GESIS Panel study were used to assess the bidirectional association between political participation and mental health. The GESIS Panel study is a probability-based panel representative of the German-speaking population residing in Germany and aged between 18 and 70 years (M = 44.52; SD = 14.67; 52 percent female participants). Mental health was assessed using measures of depression symptoms and subjective well-being. Results Using up to nine waves of longitudinal survey data, a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model indicated little evidence for cross-lagged effects from political participation to mental health or vice versa. Notwithstanding, few significant cross-lagged paths were observed. Conclusions Overall, the findings were not consistent with the theorized effect of political participation on mental health.

	abstract = {In virtually all areas of psychology, the question of whether a particular construct has a prospective effect on another is of fundamental importance. For decades, the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) has been the model of choice for addressing this question. However, CLPMs have recently been critiqued, and numerous alternative models have been proposed. Using the association between low self-esteem and depression as a case study, we examined the behavior of seven competing longitudinal models in 10 samples, each with at least four waves of data and sample sizes ranging from 326 to 8,259. The models were compared in terms of convergence, fit statistics, and consistency of parameter estimates. The traditional CLPM and the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) converged in every sample, whereas the other models frequently failed to converge or did not converge properly. The RI-CLPM exhibited better model fit than the CLPM, whereas the CLPM produced more consistent cross-lagged effects (both across and within samples) than the RI-CLPM. We discuss the models from a conceptual perspective, emphasizing that the models test conceptually distinct psychological and developmental processes, and we address the implications of the empirical findings with regard to model selection. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations for researchers interested in testing prospective associations between constructs and suggest using the CLPM when focused on between-person effects and the RI-CLPM when focused on within-person effects.

This study investigates non-electoral participation trajectories and tests intra-individual change in political participation types over time, exploring whether such dynamics depend on citizens’ exposure to political information. Utilizing a three-wave panel survey (n = 3490) and random intercept cross-lagged panel models with SEM, we find more evidence for downstream effects but detect overall diverse participation trajectories over time and a potentially crucial role of elections for non-electoral participation trajectories.},

In the late twentieth century, gay rights, immigration, gun control, and abortion debates all burst onto the political scene, scrambling the parties and polarizing the electorate. Neil A. O’Brian traces the origins of today’s political divide on these issues to the 1960s when Democrats and Republicans split over civil rights. It was this partisan polarization over race, he argues, that subsequently shaped partisan fault lines on other culture war issues that persist to this day.  Using public opinion data dating to the 1930s, O’Brian shows that attitudes about civil rights were already linked with a range of other culture war beliefs decades before the parties split on these issues—and much earlier than previous scholarship realized. Challenging a common understanding of partisan polarization as an elite-led phenomenon, The Roots of Polarization argues politicians and interest groups, jockeying for power in the changing party system, seized on these preexisting connections in the mass public to build the parties’ contemporary coalitions.},

Drawing on studies in social psychology that find that values are reformulated as individuals take on new identities and roles or process new political information, I argue that choosing sides during a major national election campaign provokes shifts in core political values. Furthermore, in keeping with Philip Converse's (1964) discussion of dynamic attitude constraint, value change following electoral mobilization is expected to lead to new positions regarding particular government policies. Backing Bill Clinton in 1992 led citizens to become more committed to egalitarianism and less attached to moral traditionalism; the reverse is hypothesized to have occurred for supporters of George Bush. In turn, changes in levels of egalitarianism caused shifts in support for federal social welfare spending; new positions on moral traditionalism led to changes regarding abortion policy. Maximum likelihood (LISREL) measurement and structural models are estimated using a CPS panel survey of the mass public in 1990 and 1992. As hypothesized, presidential preferences in 1992 led to changes in core value stands, even when measurement error and reciprocity between value positions and candidate choice were factored in. As the respondents' values changed, moreover, their positions on several concrete policy items were also significantly modified.},

But over time, the relationship between core values and partisanship among southerners strengthened remarkably.

	abstract = {As Washington elites drifted toward ideological poles over the past few decades, did ordinary Americans follow their lead? In The Partisan Sort, Matthew Levendusky reveals that we have responded to this trend—but not, for the most part, by becoming more extreme ourselves. While polarization has filtered down to a small minority of voters, it also has had the more significant effect of reconfiguring the way we sort ourselves into political parties. In a marked realignment since the 1970s—when partisan affiliation did not depend on ideology and both major parties had strong liberal and conservative factions—liberals today overwhelmingly identify with Democrats, as conservatives do with Republicans. This “sorting,” Levendusky contends, results directly from the increasingly polarized terms in which political leaders define their parties. Exploring its far-reaching implications for the American political landscape, he demonstrates that sorting makes voters more loyally partisan, allowing campaigns to focus more attention on mobilizing committed supporters. Ultimately, Levendusky concludes, this new link between party and ideology represents a sea change in American politics.},

Do voters consider candidates’ policy positions when deciding for whom to vote? And how do politicians’ performances in office factor into the voting decision? In Follow the Leader?, Gabriel S. Lenz sheds light on these central questions of democratic thought. Lenz looks at citizens’ views of candidates both before and after periods of political upheaval, including campaigns, wars, natural disasters, and episodes of economic boom and bust. Noting important shifts in voters’ knowledge and preferences as a result of these events, he finds that, while citizens do assess politicians based on their performance, their policy positions actually matter much less. Even when a policy issue becomes highly prominent, voters rarely shift their votes to the politician whose position best agrees with their own. In fact, Lenz shows, the reverse often takes place: citizens first pick a politician and then adopt that politician’s policy views. In other words, they follow the leader. Based on data drawn from multiple countries, Follow the Leader? is the most definitive treatment to date of when and why policy and performance matter at the voting booth, and it will break new ground in the debates about democracy.},

There are, however, alternative explanations for these priming findings, alternatives that previous studies have not fully considered. In this article, I reanalyze four cases of alleged priming, using panel data to test priming effects against these alternatives. Across these four cases, I find little evidence of priming effects. Instead, campaign and media attention to an issue creates the appearance of priming through a two-part process: Exposing individuals to campaign and media messages on an issue (1) informs some of them about the parties’ or candidates’ positions on that issue. Once informed, (2) these individuals often adopt their preferred party's or candidate's position as their own.},

Here, we suggest that the failure of the literature to account for conflict extension results from incomplete assumptions about individual-level partisan change. The partisan change literature typically considers only issue-based change in party identification, which necessarily leads to the aggregate prediction of conflict displacement. This ignores the possibility of party-based change in issue attitudes. If party-based issue conversion does occur, the aggregate result can be conflict extension rather than conflict displacement. Our analysis uses data from the three-wave panel studies conducted by the National Election Studies in 1956, 1958, and 1960; in 1972, 1974, and 1976; and in 1992, 1994, and 1996 to assess our alternative account of individual-level partisan change. We show that when Democratic and Republican elites are polarized on an issue, and party identifiers are aware of those differences, some individuals respond by adjusting their party ties to conform to their issue positions, but others respond by adjusting their issue positions to conform to their party identification.},

This work generally argues that anxiety affects vote choice indirectly by causing citizens to more thoroughly search for and process political information. This indirect effect of anxiety leads citizens to rely less on heuristics, such as party, and more on substantive information, such as policy positions. The most prominent example of this scholarship is the Affective Intelligence (AI) theory of emotions. In this paper, we use cross-sectional and panel survey data to test AI against two simpler alternatives: (1) that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations and (2) that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. We first show that these simpler alternatives can produce the complex, cross-sectional interactions that provide the principal support for AI. Then, using panel data to better assess causal direction, we find little support for AI, some evidence that emotions directly influence candidate evaluations, and strong evidence that candidate evaluations directly influence emotions. Scholars, we conclude, should be hesitant to abandon these simpler explanations in favor of AI.},

	abstract = {Scholars and political observers express alarm at rising affective polarization in America. Many blame demographic sorting, claiming voters’ social characteristics ("who we are") align more consistently with partisanship now than in the past. Others attribute rising polarization to increased sorting of voters’ attitudes ("what we think") by party. Unfortunately, past research lacks comparable over-time measures of demographic and attitudinal sorting — and sometimes even conflates these two constructs. This frustrates efforts to assess how much each form of sorting has contributed to rising affective polarization. In this paper, I develop measures of both forms of sorting that are comparable with each other and over time. Using data from 1952-2020, I find demographic sorting has scarcely increased over time, and its relationship with affective polarization has remained stable. By contrast, attitudinal sorting — based on symbolic ideology, policy attitudes, and group sentiments — has risen substantially since 1972. Further calculations show that the likely contribution of demographic sorting to the rise in affective polarization since 1980 is no more than 2.5\%, while attitudinal sorting can explain a meaningful share (53-63\%) of its rise. Finally, original panel analyses and a meta-analysis of past experiments indicate that the relationship between attitudinal sorting and affective polarization is likely causal. Affective polarization’s rise appears partially explained by increased partisan sorting in what we think, but not in who we are.},

There are also strong traces of hybrid effects, especially the combination of period and life-cycle processes acting to propel the younger generation at a faster clip than the older.

Bivariate and regression techniques are used in the analyses.Veterans are somewhat less cynical and have broader attention frames than civilians. Civic tolerance and feelings toward minority groups are also affected by aspects of military service. War-related opinions vary between civilians and veterans and across categories of veterans.

We examine the relationship between Whites’ prejudices, immigration attitudes, and voting behavior using a population-based panel spanning 9 years.

In contrast, research relying on traditional psychological and developmental theories suggests the relationship between most personality dimensions and political orientations are either not significant or weak. Research from behavioral genetics suggests the covariance between personality and political preferences is not causal, but due to a common, latent genetic factor that mutually influences both. The contradictory assumptions and findings from these research streams have yet to be resolved. This is in part due to the reliance on cross-sectional data and the lack of longitudinal genetically informative data. Here, using two independent longitudinal genetically informative samples, we examine the joint development of personality traits and attitude dimensions to explore the underlying causal mechanisms that drive the relationship between these features and provide a first step in resolving the causal question. We find change in personality over a ten-year period does not predict change in political attitudes, which does not support a causal relationship between personality traits and political attitudes as is frequently assumed. Rather, political attitudes are often more stable than the key personality traits assumed to be predicting them. Finally, the results from our genetic models find that no additional variance is accounted for by the causal pathway from personality traits to political attitudes. Our findings remain consistent with the original construction of the five-factor model of personality and developmental theories on attitude formation, but challenge recent work in this area.},

In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

Challenging prevailing views, they build a case for the continuing theoretical and political significance of partisan identities. The authors maintain that individuals form partisan attachments early in adulthood and that these political identities, much like religious identities, tend to persist or change only slowly over time. Scandals, recessions, and landslide elections do not greatly affect party identification; large shifts in party attachments occur only when the social imagery of a party changes, as when African Americans became part of the Democratic Party in the South after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Drawing on a wealth of data analysis using individual-level and aggregate survey data from the United States and abroad, this study offers a new perspective on party identification that will set the terms of discussion for years to come.},

However, when it comes to abortion and gay rights, the reverse may be closer to the truth.  Drawing on wide-ranging evidence, Paul Goren and Christopher Chapp show that views on abortion and gay rights are just as durable and politically impactful—and often more so—than political and religious identities. Goren and Chapp locate the lasting strength of stances on abortion and gay rights in the automatic, visceral emotions that the media has primed since the late 1980s. Moral Issues examines how attitudes toward these moralized issues affect, and can sometimes even disrupt, religious and partisan identities. Indeed, over the last thirty years, these attitudes have accelerated the rise of the religious “nones,” who have no religious affiliation, and promoted moral sorting into the Democratic and Republican parties.},

The analyses reveal that partisan identities are more stable than the principles of equal opportunity, limited government, traditional family values, and moral tolerance; party identification constrains equal opportunity, limited government, and moral tolerance; and these political values do not constrain party identification.},

Variables corresponding to the private “selective incentives” associated with protest are found to be less relevant. Furthermore, we find that engaging in protest changes many of the perceptions that influence future participation. We discuss the implications for theories of political mobilization.},

The effects of electoral and campaign participation on political efficacy are estimated in the context of a nonrecursive longitudinal model using the SRC 1972-1974-1976 panel study. It is found that these forms of participation exert positive impact mainly on the "external" or system responsiveness dimension of efficacy, and that these effects hold after controlling for educational attainment. These findings illustrate that engaging in political action does influence certain political attitudes, a fact which should be taken into account through reciprocal effects models of political attitude and behavior. The specific effect of participation on "external" efficacy also has important system-level consequences, as electoral and campaign acts influence the distribution of support for the regime or regime norms.},

To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 articles from leading journals using TWFE models for observational panel data with binary treatments.

	abstract = {Scholars have long debated the individual-level relationship between partisanship and policy preferences. We argue that partisanship and issue attitudes cause changes in each other, but the pattern of influence varies systematically. Issue-based change in party identification should occur among individuals who are aware of party differences on an issue and find that issue to be salient. Individuals who are aware of party differences, but do not attach importance to the issue, should evidence party-based issue change. Those lacking awareness of party differences on an issue should show neither effect. We test our account by examining individuals' party identifications and their attitudes on abortion, government spending and provision of services, and government help for African Americans using the 1992-94-96 National Election Study panel study, finding strong support for our argument. We discuss the implications of our findings both for the microlevel study of party identification and the macrolevel analysis of partisan change.},

	abstract = {It has been an assumption common in voting research that candidates must offer and voters must perceive opposing stands on issues for those issues to have a rational influence on the vote. Though apparently reasonable, this assumption eliminates analysis of the rational impact of style in voter thinking. This article argues that style issues should not be so easily dismissed and were of some importance in the 1972 presidential election. First, the data indicate that voters considered style issues as important as position issues. Second, voters were able to detect differences between the candidates on certain style issues. Third, salient style issues and salient position issues are similar in their causal relationship to the vote. These findings lend support to the general conclusion that style issues are an important and rational element of voter deliberations and have several implications for the study of public opinion, the behavior of political leaders, and the adequacy of elections as mechanisms of governmental accountability.},

	abstract = {In examining public evaluations of governing institutions, are job approval and legitimacy related? This question has dominated scholarship on Supreme Court legitimacy for decades. Conventional wisdom suggests that specific support (e.g., job approval) and diffuse support (e.g., legitimacy) are independent. Specific support captures short-term orientations based on policy alignment with the Court. Legitimacy is a long-term perspective reflecting more fundamental support for the Court as a governing institution. We challenge the paradigm that job approval and legitimacy are largely unrelated concepts. Specifically, we employ a variety of statistical techniques and panel data to show that changes in legitimacy are a direct effect of changes in public approval. Salient decisions and Court vacancies directly shape approval and indirectly shape legitimacy through their effects on approval. Longitudinal analysis confirms that changes in job approval precede and predict changes in legitimacy. These results suggest that the Court needs public approval, and its public approval is rooted in outcome-oriented perceptions of its decisions and membership. Further, sustained low levels of approval will eventually erode legitimacy and limit the Court's influence over policy. Thus, like the outwardly political executive and legislative branches, it is important for the Court to build political capital through job approval.},

	abstract = {Research on personality and political preferences generally assumes unidirectional causal influence of the former on the latter. However, there are reasons to believe that citizens might adopt what they perceive as politically congruent psychological attributes, or at least be motivated to view themselves as having these attributes. We test this hypothesis in a series of studies. Results of preregistered panel analyses in three countries suggest reciprocal causal influences between self-reported personality traits and political preferences. In two two-wave survey experiments, a subtle political prime at the beginning of a survey resulted in self-reported personality traits that were more aligned with political preferences gauged in a previous assessment. We discuss how concurrent assessment within the context of a political survey might overestimate the causal influence of personality traits on political preferences and how political polarization might be exacerbated by political opponents adopting different personality characteristics or self-perceptions thereof.},

	abstract = {A venerable supposition of American survey research is that the vast majority of voters have incoherent and unstable preferences about political issues, which in turn have little impact on vote choice. We demonstrate that these findings are manifestations of measurement error associated with individual survey items. First, we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same broadly defined issue area—for example, government involvement in the economy, or moral issues—eliminates a large amount of measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party identification.},

This shift in the party loyalties of the electorate was based on the increased ideological polarization of the Democratic and Republican Parties during the Reagan and post-Reagan eras. Clearer differences between the parties' ideological positions made it easier for citizens to choose a party identification based on their policy preferences. The result has been a secular realignment of party loyalties along ideological lines.},

Using data from a panel of eligible voters in Williamsburg-James City County, Virginia, three models of attitude consistency are tested: rational voting, selective perception, and persuasion. Rational voting is defined as choosing a candidate on the basis of issue positions. The debate increased voter awareness of Ford's and Carter's positions on the issue of unemployment, one of the key issues in the debate. However, there is no evidence of changes in candidate preference based on this issue. There is strong evidence of persuasion: voters adopted the position taken by their preferred candidate.},
