\description{
Simulate data from a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RICLPM) with proper intercept structure

This function creates synthetic data for a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RICLPM)
that matches the parameter structure and identification constraints of the estimateRICLPM function.
The model separates stable between-person differences (random intercepts) from within-person
dynamics (autoregressive and cross-lagged effects).
}
\details{
The Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RICLPM) decomposes each observed variable into:
- A stable between-person component (random intercept)
- A time-varying within-person component (within-person factor)
- Measurement error (fixed to 0 for perfect indicators)

Variable naming convention:
- X variables: x1, x2, x3, ..., x[waves]
- Y variables: y1, y2, y3, ..., y[waves]
- Z variables (if included): z1, z2, z3, ..., z[waves]

Model identification follows standard RICLPM practices:
- Random intercept means are estimated (unless estimate_means = FALSE)
- Within-person factor means are typically fixed to 0 (representing deviations)
- Random intercepts don't correlate with first wave within-person factors
- Observed variable residuals are fixed to 0 (perfect indicators)
