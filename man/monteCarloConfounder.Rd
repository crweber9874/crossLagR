\description{
Monte Carlo simulation for Cross-Lagged Panel Model with unmeasured confounder.
Tests how different estimators perform when data is generated with an unmeasured confounder
that affects both X and Y variables across time.
}
\details{
This function generates data using simCLPMu (which includes an unmeasured confounder)
and then fits models that may or may not account for this confounder. This allows
testing of bias introduced by unmeasured confounders.

The function tests the following scenario:
1. Data is generated with an unmeasured confounder affecting both X and Y
2. Models are fitted that ignore this confounder
3. Bias in parameter estimates is measured
