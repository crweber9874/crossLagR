\description{
Simulate data from a Linear Latent Growth Model (LGM) with options for univariate and bivariate models.
}
\details{
This function simulates data from a Linear Latent Growth Model (LGM) where:
- Growth is modeled using latent intercept, slope, and optional quadratic factors
- Individual differences exist in growth parameters
- Systematic change occurs over time according to specified growth functions

For univariate models:
- Single variable measured across time points
- Intercept factor determines initial level
- Slope factor determines rate of linear change
- Optional quadratic factor for acceleration/deceleration

For bivariate models:
- Two variables measured across time points
- Growth factors for both variables with correlations between them
- Residual covariances between variables at each time point

Parameter interpretation:
- mean_I: Average initial level across individuals
- mean_S: Average rate of linear change
- mean_Q: Average acceleration/deceleration (quadratic models)
- var_I: Individual differences in initial levels
- var_S: Individual differences in rates of change
- var_Q: Individual differences in acceleration
- cov_IS: Relationship between initial level and rate of change
- sigma2: Measurement error variance

Time scoring options:
- Default: 0, 1, 2, ..., waves-1 (intercept = initial observation)
- Custom: User-specified time points for unequal spacing
- Centered: Time scores centered around their mean
