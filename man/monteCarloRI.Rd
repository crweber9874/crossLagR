\description{
Monte Carlo simulation for Random Intercepts estimation using lmer
Allows the user to specify different Data Generating conditions, and apply the Random Intercepts model to the data.
The output is a data frame that includes the estimated coefficients across these trials
}
\details{
Random Intercepts models use lme4::lmer() to fit mixed-effects models with:
\itemize{
  \item Random intercepts for each individual
  \item Fixed effects for autoregressive and cross-lagged parameters
  \item Assumptions that individual intercepts are drawn from a normal distribution
}

This approach is intermediate between OLS (which pools individuals) and
Fixed Individual Effects (which estimates separate intercepts for each individual).
Random Intercepts models can handle unbalanced data and are more efficient when
the random intercept assumption is appropriate.
