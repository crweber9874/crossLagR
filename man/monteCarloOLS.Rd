\arguments{
\item{trials}{The number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation.}

\item{waves}{The number of waves (time points) in the model.}

\item{confounder_type}{Character string specifying confounder type for clpmu dgp.
Must be one of "time_variant" (default) or "time_invariant".}

\item{model}{Specify whether an "ols" or "clpm" model.}

\item{data_generation}{Specify the data generation method: "clpm", "ri-clpm"}

\item{proportion_change_x}{Proportion of change in x.}

\item{proportion_change_y}{Proportion of change in y.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of the simulation.
}
\description{
A somewhat strange function. It's common to estimate the cross-lagged panel model with two OLS regression models.
allows the user to specify different Data Generating conditions, and apply the OLS model to the data.
The output is a data frame that includes the estimated coefficients across these trials
